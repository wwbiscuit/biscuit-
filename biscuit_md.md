BISCUIT training details
======================

For use by BTISnet centres and participating schools and colleges
-----------------------------------------------------------------

### Syllabus 

The syllabus to be used in BISCUIT training sessions is modelled on the DBT-BINC (BIoinformatics National Certification) syllabus used for national and international certification of bioinformaticians by the Department of Biotechnology, Government of India. 

Most resources specified in the syllabus are open source, meaning that they can be downloaded and installed free of cost by anyone who has access to the internet. Training will involve key areas that are crucial to bioinformatics, such as cell biology, genetics, molecular biology, and biochemistry. However, the main point of interest will be the students' introduction to the world of bioinformatics and computational biology. This is expected to comprise both theoretical and practical components, so as to develop a well-rounded understanding of the subject. 

Bioinformatics topics and tools under consideration include working with biological databases (NCBI, EMBL, PDB, Uniprot, SwissProt, etc.), DNA, RNA and protein sequence analysis using various commonly used file formats, understanding sequence alignments, as well as structural prediction and visualization of biomolecules.
* BTISnet centres need to suggest areas to focus on, as well as specific topics or resources that they can provide training on.
* Centres need to indicate if teaching/training will be classroom based or internet based.

### Matching students with training program

Centres need to indicate availability of infrastructure.
	1. How many hours per week or per month can be allotted to training?
	2. Will PCs or laptops for training be available? Will schools have to make their own provisions?
	3. How much manpower is available to conduct the sessions?

### Medium of instruction
Depending on the city and region, training may need to be conducted in English/Hindi/regional languages.
* What language(s) can training be provided in?

### Scheduling the session

Since this will serve as a point-of-contact between the training venues and the schools/colleges participating, the following details will have to be provided when a BISCUIT training session is being organized.

1. Session venue
2. Details of session co-ordinator(name, phone no., email ID)
3. Fees to be paid for session
4. Medium(s) of instruction
5. Participating school(s)/college(s) with contact information
